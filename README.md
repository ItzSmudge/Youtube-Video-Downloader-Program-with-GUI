Youtube-Downloader-Program-with-GUI
This is a simple python program that uses pytube to retrieve urls and download youtube videos to the directory where the program is stored.
Future additions will include specification of file path for the download location and a fix for the validation error as a result of invalid inputs.
Please do not redistribute this program without acknowledgement of the owner(ThunderboltSH).
I hope you will find this program useful :)

REQUIREMENTS : The module pytube has to be installed for the program to be run.
